    "+ When a neural network learns, the earlier layers typically learn general features (like edges, shapes, or basic patterns), while deeper layers learn more task-specific features. In transfer learning, we leverage this hierarchical learning by keeping those valuable general features and modifying only what we need for our specific task\n",
    "  \n",
    "+ **Feature Extraction** involves using a pre-trained model as a fixed `feature extractor`; is like using a trained photographer's eye to judge new types of photos; examples could include monitoring changes in sentiment, or to extract specific text values, or analyze patterns in text\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Finetuning** allows the model to adapt `more specifically` to the new task, potentially yielding better performance than feature extraction alone. Instead of just adding new interpretation layers, you also allow some or all of the pre-trained layers to adjust slightly to your new task; is like taking a professional athlete and training them for a related but different sport â€“ their basic fitness and coordination transfer, but they need to adapt these skills to new requirements\n",
